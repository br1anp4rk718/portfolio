As I learned more and began to create applications from the back end all the way to front end, the realm of possibilities of what I can accomplish seemed endless. I was hooked. Soon after I decided that I needed to take the next step and accelerate my learning. That is when I chose to attend Dev Bootcamp<br><br>
	DBC is where I learned the necessary skills to call myself a full stack developer, learning various stacks of technology, and developed many applications on both the server side and front end, to be able to create meaningful and practical applications
